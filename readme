I've explained the majority of this project in my project pdf. I just want to also include some more information. From the QA/Debugging I've done, there aren't any more glaring issues or unexpected outputs. I have several forms that show up if the user tries to do something they shouldn't.

But in conclusion, should just be able to run docker-compose build and then docker-compose up for run the application.
